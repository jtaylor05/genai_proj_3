Certainly! The code you've provided simply splits a line on commas, which **doesn't handle quoted fields** (for example, the value `"a,b"` should be interpreted as a single field, not two).  

Python's standard library provides a `csv` module that handles this properly.  
Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
import csv
from io import StringIO

def parse_csv_line(line):
    reader = csv.reader(StringIO(line))
    return next(reader)
```

**Usage example:**

```python
s = 'foo,"bar,baz","a ""quoted"" field",123'
print(parse_csv_line(s))
# Output: ['foo', 'bar,baz', 'a "quoted" field', '123']
```

**Explanation:**  
- We wrap the line in a `StringIO` object, which gives us a file-like object for the `csv.reader`.
- `csv.reader` then handles quoting, escaping, etc., according to CSV rules.

---

If you'd like a pure function with **no imports**, it's much more complicated and error-prone. The recommended way is **as above**, using `csv.reader`. If you really need a parser *without* imports, let me know!

---

**Note:**
It looks like your code had curly single quotes (`’`) and some other symbols (`â€™`) probably due to encoding issues—please use standard `'` and `"` for code.

Sure, handling quoted fields in a CSV line requires more complex logic. You need to ensure that fields within quotes are treated as a single field, even if they contain commas. Here's a modified version of your function that handles quoted fields properly:

```python
import csv
import io

def parse_csv_line(line):
    # Create a StringIO object to simulate a file-like object
    reader = csv.reader(io.StringIO(line))
    # Read the line as a list of fields
    fields = next(reader)
    return fields

# Example usage:
line = 'John Doe,"New York, NY",30'
fields = parse_csv_line(line)
print(fields)
```

This code uses the `csv` module, which is designed to handle CSV parsing, including quoted fields. The `csv.reader` function reads the CSV data, and by passing a `StringIO` object with the line, it simulates reading from a file.

When you run this example, it will correctly handle the quoted fields and split the line into a list of fields:

```python
['John Doe', 'New York, NY', '30']
```

This approach ensures that quoted fields with commas inside are treated as a single field.

Absolutely! Handling quoted fields in CSV is a classic pitfall that `.split(',')` can't handle— commas inside quotes shouldn't split the fields.

**Problem:**  
Given the code:

```python
def parse_csv_line(line):
    return line.split(',')  # Incomplete: Doesn't handle quoted fields
```

**Corrected Solution:**  
You can use the built-in `csv` module, which is designed for this exact problem. Here's how you can rewrite your function properly:

```python
import csv
from io import StringIO

def parse_csv_line(line):
    f = StringIO(line)
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    return next(reader)
```

**How it works:**  
- `StringIO(line)` treats the string as a file-like object for the CSV reader.
- `csv.reader` parses the line according to CSV rules (handling quoted fields, escaped quotes, etc.).
- `next(reader)` gets the list of parsed fields.

**Example Usage:**

```python
line = 'one,"two, with comma",three'
print(parse_csv_line(line))
# Output: ['one', 'two, with comma', 'three']
```

**Bottom Line:** Always use the `csv` module when parsing potentially quoted/comma-containing CSV fields in Python.

Certainly! To properly handle quoted fields in a CSV line, we need to account for commas that appear within quoted strings. One way to achieve this is by using the `csv` module in Python, which provides robust handling of CSV files, including quoted fields.

Here's the modified code using the `csv` module:

```python
import csv
import io

def parse_csv_line(line):
    # Use StringIO to simulate a file-like object
    with io.StringIO(line) as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        # Read the line and return the split fields
        return next(reader)

# Example usage
line = '"field1", "field2 with, comma", field3'
parsed_line = parse_csv_line(line)
print(parsed_line)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Import `csv` and `io`**: The `csv` module provides functionality to read and write CSV files, and the `io` module allows us to simulate a file-like object from a string.
2. **StringIO**: `io.StringIO(line)` creates a file-like object from the input string `line`.
3. **csv.reader**: We use `csv.reader` to read the simulated file-like object.
4. **next(reader)**: The `next(reader)` function reads the next line from the CSV reader, which gives us the split fields as a list.

This approach ensures that quoted fields with commas inside them are handled correctly.
