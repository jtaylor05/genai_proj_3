Certainly! Here’s the completed implementation with comments added for clarity:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Avoids overflow
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;                // Element found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;            // Search right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;           // Search left half
        }
    }
    return -1; // Not found
}
```

**Key Details:**
- Always use `left + (right - left) / 2` for mid to prevent overflow.
- If the middle element equals the target, return `mid`.
- If the target is greater, search the right half (`left = mid + 1`).
- If the target is less, search the left half (`right = mid - 1`).
- If not found, return `-1`.

Let me know if you want a recursive version or further explanation!

Sure! To complete the `binarySearch` method, you need to compare the middle element of the array with the target value and adjust the bounds accordingly. Here's the completed implementation:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // To avoid overflow

        // Check if the target is present at mid
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }

        // If target is greater, ignore the left half
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    // Target is not present in the array
    return -1;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:** `left` is set to the first index, and `right` is set to the last index of the array.
2. **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
3. **Middle Calculation:** `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid potential overflow that can occur with `(left + right) / 2`.
4. **Comparison and Adjustment:**
   - If `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, the method returns `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, the search space is adjusted to the right half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the `target`, the search space is adjusted to the left half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.
5. **Return:** If the loop ends without finding the target, the method returns `-1`.

This implementation ensures that the binary search algorithm efficiently finds the target value in a sorted array.

Certainly! Here’s the completed Java implementation of a standard binary search:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Prevent potential overflow
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // found target
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // search right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // search left half
        }
    }
    return -1; // not found
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `left + (right - left) / 2` prevents integer overflow.
- The function returns the index of `target` if found, or `-1` otherwise.

Certainly! I'll complete the binary search implementation for you. The key is to compare the target value with the middle element of the array and adjust the bounds accordingly. Here is the completed code:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // To avoid potential overflow

        // Check if the target is present at mid
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }

        // If target is greater, ignore the left half
        if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // Target is not present in the array
    return -1;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` is set to the start of the array (index 0).
   - `right` is set to the end of the array (last index).

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

3. **Middle Calculation**:
   - `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) / 2`. This formula is used to avoid potential overflow issues that can occur with `(left + right) / 2` when `left` and `right` are very large.

4. **Comparison**:
   - If `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, the index `mid` is returned.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, the search continues in the right half by updating `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the `target`, the search continues in the left half by updating `right` to `mid - 1`.

5. **Not Found**:
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, `-1` is returned, indicating that the target is not in the array.

This implementation ensures that the binary search algorithm runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(log n).
