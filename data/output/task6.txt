Certainly! Here is a SQL schema design that fits your requirements, with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints:

```sql
-- USERS table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- BOOKS table
CREATE TABLE books (
    id    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- REVIEWS table
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id      SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    book_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating  INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    -- Each user can review a book only once
    UNIQUE (user_id, book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Explanation:

- **users**:  
  - `id`: primary key  
  - `name`: cannot be null

- **books**:  
  - `id`: primary key  
  - `title`: cannot be null

- **reviews**:  
  - `id`: primary key  
  - `user_id` and `book_id`: foreign keys referencing their respective tables
  - `rating`: integer between 1 and 5 (can be adjusted as needed)
  - **Unique constraint** on (`user_id`, `book_id`) ensures a user can only review a book once.
  - **ON DELETE CASCADE**: If a user or book is deleted, their reviews will be deleted as well.

Let me know if you want data types or constraints adjusted for a particular SQL dialect (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)!

Based on the requirements, here's a schema design for the given tables with appropriate keys and constraints:

### Schema Design

#### Table: users
- `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `name` (Not Null, Unique)

#### Table: books
- `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `title` (Not Null, Unique)

#### Table: reviews
- `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing `users(id)`, Not Null)
- `book_id` (Foreign Key referencing `books(id)`, Not Null)
- `rating` (Not Null, Check constraint to ensure rating is between 1 and 5)
- Unique constraint on (`user_id`, `book_id`) to ensure a user can only review a book once

### SQL Schema Definition

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)
);
```

### Explanation

1. **users Table**:
   - `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key to uniquely identify each user.
   - `name`: A unique and non-null field to store the user's name.

2. **books Table**:
   - `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key to uniquely identify each book.
   - `title`: A unique and non-null field to store the book's title.

3. **reviews Table**:
   - `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key to uniquely identify each review.
   - `user_id`: A foreign key referencing the `users` table, ensuring that each review is associated with a valid user. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` option ensures that if a user is deleted, all their reviews are also deleted.
   - `book_id`: A foreign key referencing the `books` table, ensuring that each review is associated with a valid book. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` option ensures that if a book is deleted, all its reviews are also deleted.
   - `rating`: A non-null field to store the rating, with a check constraint to ensure the rating is between 1 and 5.
   - A unique constraint on (`user_id`, `book_id`) to ensure that a user can only review a book once.

This schema design ensures data integrity and relationships between the tables, while also enforcing business rules such as the rating range and the uniqueness of reviews per user and book.

Certainly! Here’s a schema design for your requirements. This includes tables: `users`, `books`, and `reviews`. I’ll provide appropriate keys and constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and uniqueness where it makes sense.

```sql
-- USERS TABLE
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- BOOKS TABLE
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- REVIEWS TABLE
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    book_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_book FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT unique_user_book UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)
    -- This guarantees one review per user per book
);
```

### Explanation:

- **Primary Keys**:  
  Each table uses a unique `id` as `PRIMARY KEY`.

- **Foreign Keys**:  
  - In `reviews`, `user_id` references `users(id)` and `book_id` references `books(id)`.  
  - `ON DELETE CASCADE` so reviews are removed if the user or book is deleted.

- **Constraints**:  
  - `NOT NULL` constraints for required fields.
  - `CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)` restricts the rating value.
  - `UNIQUE (user_id, book_id)` prevents duplicate reviews by the same user for the same book.

If you have specific database requirements (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), some datatypes and constraints syntax might need slight adjustments, but this covers standard SQL conventions.

Sure, I can help you design a schema that meets the specified requirements. Here is a schema definition for the `users`, `books`, and `reviews` tables with appropriate keys and constraints:

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Reviews table
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Explanation

- **Users Table**:
  - `id`: An integer that auto-increments and serves as the primary key.
  - `name`: A varchar field that stores the user's name and cannot be null.

- **Books Table**:
  - `id`: An integer that auto-increments and serves as the primary key.
  - `title`: A varchar field that stores the book's title and cannot be null.

- **Reviews Table**:
  - `id`: An integer that auto-increments and serves as the primary key.
  - `user_id`: An integer that references the `id` field in the `users` table.
  - `book_id`: An integer that references the `id` field in the `books` table.
  - `rating`: An integer that must be between 1 and 5.
  - Foreign key constraints ensure that a review can only be made by an existing user and for an existing book. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` option ensures that if a user or a book is deleted, all related reviews are also deleted.

This schema ensures referential integrity and enforces the constraints specified in the requirements.
