To complete the `is_valid_email` function using a regular expression (regex), you can use the `re` module in Python. A common regex pattern for validating email addresses is:

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

Here's how you can implement the `is_valid_email` function:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    # Regex pattern for validating an email
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'

    # Use re.match to check if the email matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
print(is_valid_email("example@example.com"))  # Should return True
print(is_valid_email("invalid-email"))       # Should return False
```

### Explanation of the Regex Pattern:
- `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Asserts the start of the string (`^`) and matches one or more (`+`) characters that are either letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits (`0-9`), or any of the special characters `._%+-`.
- `@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the `@` symbol followed by one or more characters that are either letters, digits, dots (`.`), or hyphens (`-`).
- `\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`: Matches a dot (`.`), followed by two or more (`{2,}`) letters (uppercase or lowercase), and asserts the end of the string (`$`).

This pattern covers most common formats for email addresses. However, email validation can be complex and this pattern may not cover all edge cases. For more robust email validation, you might consider using a library like `validate_email` or `email-validator`.

```

**Explanation of the Regular Expression:**

The regular expression `r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"` is designed to validate email addresses based on common patterns. Let's break it down:

1.  `^`: Matches the beginning of the string.  This ensures that the entire string from the start must conform to the pattern, not just a part of it.

2.  `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part of the email address (the part before the "@" symbol).
    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]`:  Character class that allows:
        *   `a-z`: Lowercase letters
        *   `A-Z`: Uppercase letters
        *   `0-9`: Digits
        *   `.`: Period
        *   `_`: Underscore
        *   `%`: Percent sign
        *   `+`: Plus sign
        *   `-`: Hyphen
    *   `+`:  Quantifier that means "one or more" of the preceding characters.  This ensures that the local part isn't empty.

3.  `@`: Matches the "@" symbol, which separates the local part from the domain part.

4.  `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain part of the email address (the part after the "@" symbol, but before the top-level domain).
    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]`: Character class that allows:
        *   `a-z`: Lowercase letters
        *   `A-Z`: Uppercase letters
        *   `0-9`: Digits
        *   `.`: Period
        *   `-`: Hyphen
    *   `+`: Quantifier that means "one or more" of the preceding characters. This ensures that the domain part isn't empty.

5.  `\.`: Matches the "." (dot) that separates the domain name from the top-level domain (TLD).  The backslash `\` is used to escape the dot, as "." has a special meaning in regular expressions (it matches any character except a newline).

6.  `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches the top-level domain (TLD) such as "com", "org", "net", "us", etc.
    *   `[a-zA-Z]`: Character class that allows uppercase and lowercase letters.
    *   `{2,}`: Quantifier that means "two or more" of the preceding characters.  This ensures the TLD has at least two letters (e.g., "com"). While technically some TLDs are now shorter, requiring at least two is a common and reasonable simplification for validation.

7.  `$`: Matches the end of the string. This ensures that the entire string until the end must conform to the pattern, not just a part of it.

**How `re.match()` works and why `bool()` is used:**

*   `re.match(pattern, email)`: This function tries to match the regular expression `pattern` against the beginning of the `email` string.
    *   If a match is found, it returns a match object.
    *   If no match is found, it returns `None`.

*   `bool(re.match(pattern, email))`: This converts the result of `re.match()` to a boolean value.
    *   If `re.match()` returned a match object (meaning a match was found), the match object is considered "truthy" in Python, and `bool()` will return `True`.
    *   If `re.match()` returned `None` (meaning no match was found), `None` is considered "falsy" in Python, and `bool()` will return `False`.

In essence, the code checks if the given `email` string conforms to the defined email pattern from beginning to end.  If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Certainly! To complete the `is_valid_email` function using regex, you can use the `re` module in Python. A typical regex pattern for validating an email address can be quite complex due to the variety of valid email formats. However, a common and widely accepted regex pattern for email validation is:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    # Define the regex pattern for validating an email
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'

    # Use re.match to check if the email matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
print(is_valid_email("example@example.com"))  # Should return True
print(is_valid_email("invalid-email"))        # Should return False
```

### Explanation of the Regex Pattern:
- `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more characters that are either letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits, or one of the special characters `._%+-`.
- `@` matches the literal `@` character.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches one or more characters that are either letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits, or one of the characters `.-`.
- `\.` matches the literal `.` character.
- `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches two or more letters (uppercase or lowercase) which typically represent the domain suffix (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).
- `$` asserts the position at the end of the string.

This pattern should cover most valid email formats. However, note that email validation is complex, and this pattern may not cover all edge cases. For a more robust email validation, you might want to use a library like `email-validator`.

Could you please clarify why your code snippet works?

Certainly! Let's break down why the provided code snippet works for validating email addresses using regular expressions (regex).

### Regex Pattern Breakdown:
```python
pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
```

1. **`^`:**
   - This asserts the position at the start of the string. It ensures that the pattern matches from the very beginning of the string.

2. **`[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`:**
   - This part matches one or more characters that are:
     - Uppercase or lowercase letters (`a-zA-Z`)
     - Digits (`0-9`)
     - Special characters (`._%+-`)
   - The `+` ensures that at least one of these characters must be present.

3. **`@`:**
   - This matches the literal `@` character, which is mandatory in email addresses.

4. **`[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`:**
   - This part matches one or more characters that are:
     - Uppercase or lowercase letters (`a-zA-Z`)
     - Digits (`0-9`)
     - Special characters (`.-`)
   - The `+` ensures that at least one of these characters must be present.

5. **`\.`:**
   - This matches the literal `.` character, which is part of the domain name (e.g., the `.` in `example.com`).

6. **`[a-zA-Z]{2,}`:**
   - This matches two or more uppercase or lowercase letters. It represents the domain suffix (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).

7. **`$`:**
   - This asserts the position at the end of the string. It ensures that the pattern matches until the very end of the string.

### How the Code Works:
1. **Import the `re` Module:**
   ```python
   import re
   ```
   This module provides support for regular expressions in Python.

2. **Define the Function:**
   ```python
   def is_valid_email(email):
   ```
   This defines a function `is_valid_email` that takes an `email` as an argument.

3. **Define the Regex Pattern:**
   ```python
   pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
   ```
   This line defines the regex pattern for validating an email address.

4. **Use `re.match` to Check the Pattern:**
   ```python
   if re.match(pattern, email):
   ```
   This line checks if the `email` string matches the defined regex pattern. `re.match` returns a match object if the pattern matches the string, otherwise it returns `None`.

5. **Return `True` or `False`:**
   ```python
   if re.match(pattern, email):
       return True
   else:
       return False
   ```
   If the `email` matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example Usage:
```python
print(is_valid_email("example@example.com"))  # Should return True
print(is_valid_email("invalid-email"))        # Should return False
```
- `"example@example.com"` is a valid email address and should return `True`.
- `"invalid-email"` does not follow the email format and should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet works by using a specific regex pattern to validate the format of the email address. It ensures that the email has a valid format according to the defined rules, which include the presence of an `@` symbol, a local part, a domain, and a domain suffix. This simple yet effective approach helps to catch most common email formatting errors.
