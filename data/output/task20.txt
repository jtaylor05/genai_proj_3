Certainly! To complete the function `calculate_average`, you need to iterate through the list of scores, sum them up, and then compute the average. Here's the completed function:

```python
def calculate_average(scores):
    total = 0
    # Sum all the scores
    for score in scores:
        total += score
    # Calculate the average
    average = total / len(scores)
    return average
```

Here's a brief explanation of what each part does:
1. **Initialization**: You start with `total` set to 0.
2. **Summing Scores**: The `for` loop iterates through each `score` in the `scores` list and adds it to `total`.
3. **Calculating Average**: After summing all the scores, you divide `total` by the number of scores (which is `len(scores)`) to get the average.
4. **Returning the Average**: Finally, the function returns the calculated average.

Here is an example of how you might use this function:

```python
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print("The average score is:", average)
```

This will output:
```
The average score is: 86.6
```

Okay, let's break down how to complete this Python function.

**Understanding the Goal**

The function `calculate_average` takes a list called `scores` as input. The goal is to calculate the average of the numbers within that list. We already have a `total` variable initialized to 0, ready to accumulate the sum of the scores.

**Steps to Complete the Function**

1.  **Iterate through the Scores:** We need to go through each number in the `scores` list and add it to the `total`. A `for` loop is perfect for this.
2.  **Calculate the Sum:** Inside the loop, we'll add each score to the `total`.
3.  **Calculate the Average:** After the loop finishes, we'll have the sum of all scores in the `total` variable. To get the average, we need to divide the `total` by the number of scores in the list.  We can get the number of scores using the `len()` function.
4.  **Handle Empty List:**  We should add a check to make sure the list isn't empty.  If it's empty, trying to divide by zero will cause an error.  In that case, we'll return 0.
5.  **Return the Average:** Finally, we'll return the calculated average.

**Python Code**

```python
def calculate_average ( scores ) :
    total = 0
    # TODO : Complete to return average
    if not scores: # Check if the list is empty
        return 0
    for score in scores:
        total += score
    average = total / len(scores)
    return average
```

**Explanation**

*   `if not scores:`: This line checks if the `scores` list is empty.  An empty list evaluates to `False` in a boolean context, so `not scores` will be `True` if the list is empty.
*   `return 0`: If the list is empty, we return 0 to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`.
*   `for score in scores:`: This loop iterates through each element (score) in the `scores` list.
*   `total += score`:  This adds the current `score` to the running `total`.
*   `average = total / len(scores)`:  After the loop, this calculates the average by dividing the `total` by the number of scores.
*   `return average`: This returns the calculated average value.

Sure! To complete the `calculate_average` function, we need to compute the average of a list of scores. The average is obtained by summing all the scores and then dividing by the number of scores. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialize the Total Sum**: Start with a variable to keep track of the total sum of the scores. This is already done in the provided code with `total = 0`.

2. **Sum the Scores**: Iterate through the list of scores and add each score to the `total`.

3. **Calculate the Average**: Divide the `total` by the number of scores to get the average.

4. **Return the Average**: Return the computed average.

Here is the completed function with the explanation inline:

```python
def calculate_average(scores):
    total = 0
    # Sum all the scores
    for score in scores:
        total += score

    # Calculate the average
    average = total / len(scores)

    # Return the average
    return average
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   total = 0
   ```
   This initializes the `total` variable to 0, which will hold the sum of the scores.

2. **Iterate and Sum**:
   ```python
   for score in scores:
       total += score
   ```
   This loop goes through each score in the `scores` list and adds it to `total`.

3. **Compute the Average**:
   ```python
   average = total / len(scores)
   ```
   Here, `total` is divided by the number of scores (`len(scores)`), which gives the average score.

4. **Return the Result**:
   ```python
   return average
   ```
   Finally, the computed average is returned.

### Example Usage:
```python
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print(average)  # Output: 86.4
```

This function will correctly calculate and return the average of the list of scores provided to it.
