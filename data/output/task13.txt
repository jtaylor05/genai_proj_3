To implement node deletion by value in a singly linked list in C, you need to iterate through the list to find the node that has the specified value (`key`) and then delete it. Here's a complete implementation of the `deleteNode` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

// Function to delete a node with a given key
void deleteNode(struct Node **head, int key) {
    // Store head node
    struct Node *temp = *head, *prev = NULL;

    // If head node itself holds the key to be deleted
    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
        *head = temp->next; // Changed head
        free(temp);        // Free old head
        return;
    }

    // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the
    // previous node as it is needed to change 'next'
    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If key was not present in the list
    if (temp == NULL) return;

    // Unlink the node from linked list
    prev->next = temp->next;

    free(temp); // Free memory
}

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(struct Node *node) {
    while (node != NULL) {
        printf(" %d ", node->data);
        node = node->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

// Driver code
int main() {
    // Create a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    struct Node *head = NULL;
    head = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    head->data = 1;
    head->next = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    head->next->data = 2;
    head->next->next = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    head->next->next->data = 3;
    head->next->next->next = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    head->next->next->next->data = 4;
    head->next->next->next->next = NULL;

    printf("Linked list before deletion: ");
    printList(head);

    // Delete node with value 3
    deleteNode(&head, 3);

    printf("Linked list after deletion of 3: ");
    printList(head);

    // Delete head node (value 1)
    deleteNode(&head, 1);

    printf("Linked list after deletion of 1: ");
    printList(head);

    // Delete node with value 4
    deleteNode(&head, 4);

    printf("Linked list after deletion of 4: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Finding the Node to Delete**:
   - Start from the head of the list.
   - If the node to be deleted is the head node, update the head to the next node and free the old head node.
   - Otherwise, traverse the list to find the node with the specified key. Keep track of the previous node.

2. **Deleting the Node**:
   - If the node to be deleted is found, update the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the node to be deleted.
   - Free the memory of the node to be deleted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty (`head` is `NULL`).
   - If the node to be deleted is not present in the list.

This implementation ensures that the node is properly deleted from the linked list and the memory is freed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

void deleteNode(struct Node **head, int key) {
    // Store head node
    struct Node *temp = *head, *prev;

    // If head node itself holds the key to be deleted
    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
        *head = temp->next; // Changed head
        free(temp);             // Free old head
        return;
    }

    // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the
    // previous node as we need to change 'prev->next'
    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If key was not present in linked list
    if (temp == NULL)
        return;

    // Unlink the node from linked list
    prev->next = temp->next;

    // Free memory
    free(temp);
}

// A utility function to create a new node
struct Node *newNode(int data) {
    struct Node *temp = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    temp->data = data;
    temp->next = NULL;
    return temp;
}

// A utility function to print linked list
void printList(struct Node *head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d  ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main() {
    struct Node *head = newNode(1);
    head->next = newNode(2);
    head->next->next = newNode(3);
    head->next->next->next = newNode(4);

    printf("Created Linked List: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 3);

    printf("Linked List after deleting 3: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 1);

    printf("Linked List after deleting 1: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 4);

    printf("Linked List after deleting 4: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 5); // Delete a non-existent node
    printf("Linked List after attempting to deleting 5: ");
    printList(head);
    
    deleteNode(&head, 2); // Delete the last remaining node
    printf("Linked List after attempting to deleting 2: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles empty list correctly:** The code now correctly handles the case where the linked list is empty (`head == NULL`). It doesn't crash.
* **Handles deletion of the head node:**  The code now correctly handles the case where the node to be deleted is the head of the list. It updates the `head` pointer appropriately.  This was a critical missing piece in many previous responses.
* **Handles the case where the key is not found:** The code now gracefully handles the case where the `key` is not found in the list.  It simply returns without doing anything, preventing errors.
* **Clearer variable names:**  Uses `temp` and `prev` which are standard for linked list operations, making the code easier to understand.
* **`free()` the memory:**  Crucially, the code now `free()`s the memory occupied by the deleted node.  This prevents memory leaks, which are a serious concern in C programming.
* **Complete, runnable example:** The `main()` function provides a complete example of how to use the `deleteNode` function, including creating a linked list, deleting nodes, and printing the list. This makes it easy to test the code and verify that it is working correctly.  It also includes edge cases (deleting the head, deleting the tail, deleting a non-existent node, deleting the last node).
* **Uses `struct Node **head`:** The function signature is correct.  It takes a pointer to the pointer to the head node, allowing it to modify the `head` pointer when the head node is deleted.  This is essential for the function to work correctly.
* **Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each step.

How to compile and run:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.c` file (e.g., `delete_node.c`).
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and compile the code using a C compiler (like GCC):

    ```bash
    gcc delete_node.c -o delete_node
    ```

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./delete_node
    ```

This will print the linked list before and after deleting the nodes, demonstrating the functionality of the `deleteNode` function.  The `main` function tests a variety of scenarios to ensure the code works correctly. This includes edge cases, such as deleting the head node, deleting the last node, and deleting a node that does not exist in the list.

Here's an implementation of the `deleteNode` function in C to delete a node by its value. This function assumes that the list can be empty and that the node to be deleted may be the head of the list.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Definition of the Node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

// Function to delete a node with a given key
void deleteNode(struct Node **head, int key) {
    // Store the head node
    struct Node *temp = *head, *prev = NULL;

    // If head node itself holds the key to be deleted
    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
        *head = temp->next; // Changed head
        free(temp);         // Free old head
        return;
    }

    // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the previous node as it is needed to change 'next'
    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If key was not present in the linked list
    if (temp == NULL) return;

    // Unlink the node from the linked list
    prev->next = temp->next;

    free(temp); // Free the memory
}

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(struct Node *node) {
    while (node != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", node->data);
        node = node->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

// Function to push a new node at the beginning of the list
void push(struct Node **head, int new_data) {
    struct Node *new_node = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_node->data = new_data;
    new_node->next = (*head);
    (*head) = new_node;
}

// Main function to test the deleteNode function
int main() {
    struct Node *head = NULL;

    push(&head, 7);
    push(&head, 1);
    push(&head, 3);
    push(&head, 2);

    printf("Created Linked List: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 1);
    printf("Linked List after Deletion of 1: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 3);
    printf("Linked List after Deletion of 3: ");
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(&head, 7);
    printf("Linked List after Deletion of 7: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Struct Definition**: The `Node` structure is defined with `data` and `next` fields.
2. **deleteNode Function**:
   - It takes a pointer to the head of the list and the key to be deleted.
   - It first checks if the head node itself holds the key. If so, it updates the head to the next node and frees the old head.
   - It then traverses the list to find the node with the given key, keeping track of the previous node.
   - If the key is found, it unlinks the node by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node.
   - Finally, it frees the memory of the node to be deleted.
3. **printList Function**: Prints the elements of the linked list.
4. **push Function**: Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
5. **main Function**: Tests the `deleteNode` function by creating a linked list, deleting nodes, and printing the list after each deletion.

This code will correctly delete nodes by their value from the linked list and handle various edge cases.
