The most straightforward and correct name would be:

*   `isEven`

This aligns perfectly with the function's logic: `return x % 2 == 0;` which evaluates to `true` when `x` is divisible by 2 (i.e., even).

Here are a few other options, although `isEven` is the best:

*   `isEvenNumber` (More verbose, but emphasizes it's checking a number)
*   `isDivisibleByTwo` (Very explicit about the divisibility condition)

### Suggested Function Name

The function name `isOdd` is misleading because it returns `true` when the input `x` is even, not odd. A more correct name for this function would be `isEven`.

```cpp
// Returns true if x is even
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

### Alternative Solution

Alternatively, you could keep the original function name `isOdd` and correct the logic inside the function to return `true` when `x` is odd.

```cpp
// Returns true if x is odd
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}
```

### Best Practice

It's essential to ensure that function names accurately reflect their behavior to avoid confusion and make the code more maintainable. In this case, either renaming the function to `isEven` or correcting its logic to match the name `isOdd` is a good practice.

The correct name for the given function should be `isEven`. 

The function is currently named `isOdd`, but it returns `true` if `x` is even, not odd. The condition `x % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even. To fix this, either the function name or the return condition should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version with the function name changed:

```cpp
// Returns true if x is even
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

Alternatively, you could change the return condition to correctly implement `isOdd`:

```cpp
// Returns true if x is odd
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}
```
